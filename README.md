# Forsen Chronicles
Edgy-humor rpg game based around twitch.tv streamer Forsen (https://www.twitch.tv/forsen)  
One of my first finished projects(**in 2017**), during which I learned the basics of programming and Unity Engine(before starting university).  
### Because of the above, the quality of the code does not represent my current programming skill, which you can see in newer projects.

The inside jokes in this game won't be funny for anyone not familiar to Forsens stream.  
I did not intend to offend anybody with the game, so please take it with a grain of salt.
